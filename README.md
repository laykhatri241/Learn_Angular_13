# Components Communication

  -> Components have their own variables and methods. 
  -> There can be a scenario where a parent component needs to send some data to child component or visa versa.
  -> Components are made to modularize. So we create a component which can handle only that section.
  
## Ways of Communcation

  1) Binding (@Input & @Output)
  2) Reference (@ViewChild & @ContentChild)
  3) Provider (Service)
  4) Template Outlet

### Command to create Component
  
    -> ng g c <component_Name>
